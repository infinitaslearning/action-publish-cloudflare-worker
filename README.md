# action-publish-cloudflare-worker

## Reasoning
Currently, `wrangler` does not allow to publish a bundle without also building it first. This behaviour might be 
undesirable on a GitHub workflow when, for example, you want to roll back a previous version of the worker.

This GitHub actions uses cloudflare api instead of wrangler, so you can split up the building and the publishing.
